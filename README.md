## Usage

### Running the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501` in your default browser.

**Steps to use**:
1. Select input mode in the sidebar:
   - **📊 Tabular Data**: Click "Upload Patient Data (CSV)" and select your file
   - **🎙️ Voice Samples**: Click "Upload Voice Samples" and select WAV, MP3, FLAC, or OGG files
   - **🎤 Live Recording**: Click the record button to capture audio directly
2. View risk predictions and analytics in the dashboard tabs

### Voice Sample Processing

When uploading voice samples, the app automatically extracts the following acoustic features:

- **Energy & Amplitude**: Mean, standard deviation, maximum amplitude
- **Spectral Features**: Centroid, rolloff
- **Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR)**: Voice activity indicator
- **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**: 13 coefficients capturing voice characteristics
- **Chroma Features**: 12 pitch-class features
- **Fundamental Frequency (F0)**: Pitch estimates (mean, std, min, max)
- **RMS Energy**: Root Mean Square energy of audio frames
- **Onset Strength**: Voice articulation measure

These features are then fed into the trained model to predict ALS risk probability.

### Training the Model

To retrain the model on new data:

```bash
python train_tabular.py
```

This will:
- Load features from `processed_features.csv`
- Train an XGBoost classifier
- Save model, scaler, and features to `models/`
- Generate `models/metrics.json` with performance metrics

### Preparing Data

To prepare raw data for training:


   ```bash
   python prepare_data.py
   ```

   This script processes raw voice biomarker data and extracts features.

   ### Generating Synthetic Data

   For testing, development, and validation purposes, the platform provides tools to generate synthetic voice samples and tabular data.

   #### 1. Synthetic Voice Samples

   Generate synthetic voice recordings with ALS-like characteristics:

   ```bash
   python synthetic_audio.py
   ```

   This creates a `synthetic voice` folder with 20 subjects:
   - **10 Controls (CT001-CT010)**: Healthy voice samples with low noise
   - **10 Patients (PZ001-PZ010)**: ALS-simulated voice samples with dysarthria effects

   **Generated Phonations** (8 types per subject):

   | Type | Description | Duration |
   |------|-------------|----------|
   | phonationA | Vowel "A" sustain | 3 seconds |
   | phonationE | Vowel "E" sustain | 3 seconds |
   | phonationI | Vowel "I" sustain | 3 seconds |
   | phonationO | Vowel "O" sustain | 3 seconds |
   | phonationU | Vowel "U" sustain | 3 seconds |
   | rhythmKA | Repeated syllables | ~2.5 seconds (5 bursts) |
   | rhythmPA | Repeated syllables | ~2.5 seconds (5 bursts) |
   | rhythmTA | Repeated syllables | ~2.5 seconds (5 bursts) |

   **Control vs. ALS-Simulated Characteristics**:

   | Aspect | Controls | ALS Patients |
   |--------|----------|-------------|
   | Noise Level | 0.005 | 0.05 (10x higher) |
   | Tremor | None | 5Hz tremolo modulation |
   | Burst Timing | Regular | Irregular (dysarthria) |
   | Voice Quality | Clean | Breathy/dysarthric |

   **Output Format**: WAV files (8kHz sample rate, 32-bit float)

   #### 2. Synthetic Tabular Data

   Generate synthetic feature datasets for model testing:

   ```bash
   python synthetic_data.py
   ```

   This creates `synthetic_univariate_10000_ALS.csv` with:
   - **10,000 synthetic records**
   - **131 biomarker features** matching the training model
   - **Binary labels** (0: No ALS, 1: ALS)
   - **Realistic feature distributions** based on training data

   **Use Cases**:
   - Quick model validation without uploading real patient data
   - Stress testing the dashboard with large datasets
   - Feature extraction pipeline verification
   - Performance benchmarking

   #### 3. Folder Structure After Generation

- `feature_names.pkl`

### "Could not coerce label column to integer"
Label columns must contain numeric values (0 or 1). Rename string labels if needed.

### "Imputing missing features"
Your CSV may be missing some of the 131 required features. Missing features default to 0, which may reduce accuracy. Ensure all feature columns are included.

### Performance metrics not showing
If no label column is detected, the app will show a warning and display only reference training metrics. Ensure your CSV has a column named `label` or `Diagnosis (ALS)` with 0/1 values.

### "Error extracting audio features"
- Ensure audio file is not corrupted
- Try converting to WAV format (most reliable)
- Minimum duration should be 1 second
- Supported formats: WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG

### Live recording not working
- Install streamlit-webrtc: `pip install streamlit-webrtc`
- Ensure your browser allows microphone access
- Check that you have an active microphone device
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)

## Output

## Synthetic Data Guide

### Overview

Synthetic data is crucial for:
- **Development & Testing**: Safely test new features without real patient data
- **Model Validation**: Verify the pipeline works correctly
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Test scalability with large datasets
- **Educational Use**: Demonstrate platform capabilities

### Generation Scripts

#### synthetic_audio.py

**Purpose**: Generates synthetic voice samples simulating healthy controls and ALS patients

**Key Parameters**:
```python
n_controls = 10       # Number of control subjects
n_patients = 10       # Number of ALS-simulated subjects
sr = 8000             # Sample rate in Hz
duration = 3.0        # Duration per phonation in seconds
```

**Audio Generation Algorithm**:

1. **Base Tone Generation**:
   - Fundamental frequency: 80-300 Hz (realistic voice range)
   - Harmonics: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order (voice-like quality)
   - Gaussian noise layer for natural variation

2. **Control Characteristics** (Healthy):
   - Low noise level: 0.005
   - Stable pitch and amplitude
   - Regular burst timing (for rhythm phonations)

3. **ALS-Simulated Characteristics**:
   - High noise level: 0.05 (10× increase = breathiness)
   - Tremolo modulation: 5Hz tremor (voice instability)
   - Irregular burst timing (±50ms variation)
   - Irregular silence duration (dysarthria simulation)

**Feature Extraction from Synthetic Audio**:
When uploaded, synthetic voice samples extract:
- Amplitude statistics (mean, std, max)
- Spectral centroid and rolloff
- MFCCs (13 coefficients)
- Fundamental frequency (F0) estimates
- Energy and RMS metrics
- Zero crossing rate

#### synthetic_data.py

**Purpose**: Generates synthetic feature vectors for quick model validation

**Output**:
- **Filename**: `synthetic_univariate_10000_ALS.csv`
- **Rows**: 10,000 synthetic records
- **Columns**: 131 biomarker features + 1 label column

**Feature Generation**:
- Based on statistical properties of training data (mean, std)
- Realistic correlations between features preserved
- Two classes: 0 (No ALS), 1 (ALS)

**Use Cases**:
```bash
# Quick validation without real data
python synthetic_data.py
# Then upload synthetic_univariate_10000_ALS.csv to streamlit app
```

### Testing Workflow

**Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data**
```bash
python synthetic_audio.py      # Creates synthetic voice/
python synthetic_data.py       # Creates synthetic_univariate_10000_ALS.csv
```

**Step 2: Test Voice Processing**
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# Select "Voice Samples" mode
# Upload WAV from synthetic voice/phonationA/
# Verify feature extraction and risk prediction
```

**Step 3: Test Tabular Data Processing**
```bash
# In streamlit app, select "Tabular Data" mode
# Upload synthetic_univariate_10000_ALS.csv
# View dashboard with 10,000 records
# Verify model inference and performance metrics
```

### Expected Results

**Voice Samples**:
- Controls: Lower risk probabilities (typically <40%)
- ALS patients: Higher risk probabilities (typically >60%)
- Due to simulated dysarthria effects (noise, tremor)

**Tabular Data**:
- Accuracy: ~70-85% on synthetic data
- ROC AUC: ~0.75-0.90
- Balanced class distribution in risk categories

### Customizing Synthetic Data

Edit these files to customize generation:

**synthetic_audio.py**:
```python
n_controls = 50        # Increase controls
n_patients = 50        # Increase patients
noise_level = 0.08     # Higher noise = more dysarthric
```

**synthetic_data.py**:
```python
n_samples = 50000      # Change dataset size
random_state = 42      # Reproducible results
```

### Limitations

Synthetic data is **not a substitute for real clinical data**:
- Simplified acoustic model (single harmonics)
- Does not capture all real dysarthria characteristics
- Feature distributions may differ from real patients
- Should not be used for clinical deployment

**Use for**: Development, testing, and education only
